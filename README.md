For my Programming 1 module in first year the coursework was a program with many different parts, that was required to have OOP and debugging. This was completed 10/1/2021. The requirements were four pages long so I will post the full thing in a separate file.

This project had a few issues. Again I had issues with loading the csv file, especially when loading information from a previous run of the program. I am also still new to OOP concepts, and so Iâ€™m sure the OOP in this could have been much more efficient. There also could have been much stricter validation rules applied to several of the user input areas.
